Approach
To build this app, I first researched the different technologies and libraries that would be needed to create an interactive world map with hexagon bins. I then created a new React app and installed the necessary dependencies, including react-simple-maps and D3.js

Next, I created a new React component to render the map, using Leaflet to create the map layer and D3.js to create the hexagon bins. I also added a tooltip to display the data for each hexagon bin on hover.

Finally, I deployed the app to Netlify to make it publicly accessible. Throughout the development process, I made use of best practices for React and JavaScript development, including modular code architecture, proper error handling, and effective debugging techniques.
